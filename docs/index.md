# Introduction

_keycuts_ is a modern Javascript library for handling keyboard shortcuts. It supports listening for key combinations, key sequences and a mix of both. _keycuts_ has no external dependencies and a small footprint (~8kb, gzipped ~3kb).

# Demo

An example of what _keycuts_ can do for you can be found [on the demo site](./demo/index.html).

## FAQ

**Why another Javascript keyboard library?**

The existing keyboard shortcut libraries I have found all use the now deprecated [`charCode`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/charCode) and [`keyCode`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/keyCode) attributes of [`KeyboardEvent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent). _keycuts_ uses the newer [`key`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/key) and [`code`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/code) attributes instead. It also adds features not found in the other libraries.

**What browsers are supported?**

By using the above mentioned newer (and not deprecated) `key` and `code` attributes of `KeyboardEvend` _keycuts_ only supports [modern browser](https://caniuse.com/#feat=keyboardevent-key) (especially IE >= 11). If you need to support older browsers then _keycuts_ is not for you and you have to look somewhere else (e.g. [Hotkeys](https://github.com/jaywcjlove/hotkeys), [Keypress](https://github.com/dmauro/Keypress/), [keymaster.js](https://github.com/madrobby/keymaster), [Mousetrap](https://github.com/ccampbell/mousetrap), [KeyboardJS](https://github.com/RobertWHurst/KeyboardJS)).

**What keys are supported?**

_keycuts_ is completely key agnostic. All printable keys and all non printable keys listed in the [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/key/Key_Values) are supported. The naming schema of the non printable keys is the key value stated in the MDN web docs, except for the space key (' ' in the MDN docs) which is named `Space` in _keycuts_ (just better visible in a shortcut).

**Under what license is _keycuts_ published?**

The very liberal MIT license.

**Can I support this library somehow?**
Absolutely! If you are a writer by improving the documentation. If you are a coder by fixing bugs and writing tests. If you are a creative mind by suggesting features. If you are damn rich by donating money or even better BTC / ETH (see Donations).
